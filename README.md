## Details
Emulair is an Android exclusive open-source front-end for Libretro cores. It was originally based completely on Lemuroid, however I decided to rewrite it (mostly) from scratch.

## Philosophy
The primary goal of Emulair is to combine an easy to use console-like interface with RetroArch's extensive customizability, features and built-in cores, while also adding support for standalone emulators.

## Origin
It's inspired by [Lemuroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid), which, in turn, is based off of [Retrograde](https://github.com/retrograde/retrograde-android). It will also use [SuperLibretroDroid](https://github.com/EmulairEmulator/SuperLibretroDroid) under the hood to run [Libretro](https://github.com/libretro) cores. <br />
The old Emulair used to include some 2D sprites for the systems that were taken from [hakchi2](https://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2) and [Faustbear](https://imgur.com/gallery/8RQ1QkA).

## Name Meaning
"Emulair" is a triple entendre and the name is inspired by the Lawnchair launcher (not associated with Emulair). Firstly, "Emulair" kind of sounds like the word "Emulator" (if you try hard enough). Secondly, "Emulair" means "lair of the emu bird", an animal whose name is similar to the abbreviation of the word "emulator". Lastly, "Emulair" also means "lair for all your emulators", which is similar in name to "Vimm's Lair", a place for preserving video games.
